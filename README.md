# Object Detection Project using OpenCV DNN

A lightweight object detection system built with OpenCV's `cv2.dnn_DetectionModel` for efficient deep learning-based object detection.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using OpenCV's DNN module
- Supports common models (YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN) through `cv2.dnn_DetectionModel`
- No heavy dependencies - just OpenCV (cv2) required
- CPU-efficient inference (GPU optional)
- Easy model swapping with different pre-trained weights

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
